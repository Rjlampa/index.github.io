<p style="font-style:Courier New;color: royalblue;text-align: center;"><i>Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately
    <br>Focused on the things that didn't make no sense
    <br>Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy<br>
    Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways
   <br> Didn't really care about how anyone felt<br>
    Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays</i></p>
    <p style="font:Tahoma;color: red;text-align:left;"><u>Oh, but what is lost ain't gone<br>
        No, you can't just let go<br>
        'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong<br>
        Embrace your flaws </u></p>

    <p style="font-family: Chiller;color: seagreen; text-align: center;font-size: larger;"><i>I'm not gonna fight back what I've become<br>
        Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from<br>
        But I wouldn't change if I could restart<br>
        I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars<br>
        I've been going way too hard on myself<br>
        Guess that it's the reason I've been feeling like hell<br>
        But I wouldn't change if I could restart<br>
        I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars</i></p>
    <p style="font-family: Harrington;color: orange;text-align: right;"><i>I went down a road that only got me nowhere<br>
        I've seen every corner, every inch of this place<br>
        Being all alone it really got me thinking, maybe overthinking</i></p>
    <p style="font-family: Forte;color: yellow;text-align: center;"><i><b>That what is lost ain't gone<br>
        No, you can't just let go<br>
        'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong<br>
        Embrace your flaws</i></b></p>
